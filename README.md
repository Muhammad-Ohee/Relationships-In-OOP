# Relationships In OOP

Object oriented programming generally support 4 types of relationships that are: ***inheritance*** , ***association***, ***composition*** and ***aggregation***. All these relationship is based on ***"is a"*** relationship, ***"has a"*** relationship and ***"part of"*** relationship.

**Inheritance:**<br>
Inheritance is “IS-A” type of relationship. “IS-A” relationship is a totally based on Inheritance, which can be of two types Class Inheritance or Interface Inheritance. Inheritance is a parent-child relationship where we create a new class by using existing class code. It is just like saying that “A is type of B”. For example is “Apple is a fruit”, “Ferrari is a car”.
