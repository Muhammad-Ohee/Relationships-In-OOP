# Relationships In OOP

Object oriented programming generally support 4 types of relationships that are: ***inheritance*** , ***association***, ***composition*** and ***aggregation***. All these relationship is based on ***"is a"*** relationship, ***"has a"*** relationship and ***"part of"*** relationship.

**Inheritance:**<br>
Inheritance is “IS-A” type of relationship. “IS-A” relationship is a totally based on Inheritance, which can be of two types Class Inheritance or Interface Inheritance. Inheritance is a parent-child relationship where we create a new class by using existing class code. It is just like saying that “A is type of B”. For example is “Apple is a fruit”, “Ferrari is a car”.

**Composition:**<br>

Composition is a "part-of" relationship. Simply composition means mean use of instance variables that are references to other objects. In composition relationship both entities are interdependent of each other for example “engine is part of car”, “heart is part of body”.

Let us take an example of car and engine. Engine is a part of each car and both are dependent on each other.
